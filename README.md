**Cursed To Jump** is a simple one-button platformer where your character is always moving, and the only thing you can do is jump.

Your goal: reach the other side of each level to eventually reach the treasure chest at the end of the game using carefully timed jumps. The game includes 10 hand-made levels with increasing difficulty.
